# Water Bubbly - Prototype

Simple responsive prototype for a hyperlocal water-can booking app.

How to run:
- Open `index.html` in a browser (no build needed).
- Data persists in `localStorage` per browser.

Pages:
- `index.html`: Welcome / Login / Signup (OTP demo)
- `pages/dashboard.html`: Dashboard & navigation
- `pages/products.html`: Product grid with Add to Cart
- `pages/cart.html`: Cart + 12% GST + confirm order
- `pages/orders.html`: Order history with status progression
- `pages/profile.html`: View/Edit profile
- `pages/help.html`: Help

Styling:
- Blue/white theme; responsive grid; external CSS in `css/style.css`.

Notes:
- Replace localStorage with a backend later.
- Demo OTP is displayed on the screen.
